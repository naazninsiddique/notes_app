Fullstack Notes App using React (frontend) + FastAPI (backend) + SQLite + JWT Authentication. Users can register, login, and manage personal notes securely. The app supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. Passwords are validated to be at least 6 characters, duplicate emails are prevented, and JWT authentication is used to secure all protected endpoints. Pydantic ensures note title and content are not empty. Optional versioning can prevent race conditions during updates. The backend handles database sessions safely, validating the SQLite DB path at startup to prevent crashes. For production, httpOnly cookies and refresh tokens are recommended, though JWT in localStorage is acceptable for this assignment.

To install the backend, navigate to the backend folder, run pip install -r requirements.txt, and start the server using uvicorn main:app --reload. The frontend can be installed by navigating to the frontend folder, running npm install, and starting with npm start. The backend runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000 and the frontend on http://localhost:3000. Auth endpoints include POST /register for user registration and POST /login to obtain a JWT token. Notes endpoints, which require JWT authentication, include GET /notes to fetch all notes, POST /notes to create a note, PUT /notes/{id} to update a note, and DELETE /notes/{id} to delete a note.

Safety and error handling include preventing unauthorized access (401 Unauthorized for missing/invalid tokens), weak passwords or duplicate registration, token theft mitigation through secure cookies in production, validation to prevent empty note titles or content, optional version control to prevent lost updates or race conditions, and safe DB session handling to avoid crashes. The frontend is built with React, HTML, CSS, and Axios, while the backend uses FastAPI, Pydantic, JWT, and SQLite.

To use the app, register a new user, login to get the JWT token, and then access the notes endpoints to create, edit, or delete notes. This project is intended for educational purposes and personal assignments.
